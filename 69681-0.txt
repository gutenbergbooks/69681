FOREWORD


In the assembling of material so widely scattered and so long unsought
either by students or by collectors, it has been necessary for me
to depend in some measure on the efforts of others who have been
most generous with their help and assistance. I desire to record
my gratitude especially to my Father and my Mother, without whose
unfailing sympathy and co-operation this work could not have been done:
and to Mrs. C. Francis Osborne of Philadelphia, Miss Sallie Shepherd
of Norfolk, Virginia, and Miss Florence D. Johnston of Philadelphia,
for books and individual poems. For their courtesy in allowing me free
access to the collections committed to their charge I must acknowledge
further indebtedness to Mr. Wallace H. Cathcart, Vice-President and
Director of the Western Reserve Historical Society, Cleveland, whose
splendid collection of Civil War items contains many rare and important
imprints and broadsides: and to Mr. Bunford Samuel, of the Ridgway
Branch of the Library Company of Philadelphia, to whose private
collection I am indebted for several poems which I have not found
elsewhere.

Particularly to Dr. Arthur Hobson Quinn of the University of
Pennsylvania, under whose direction this thesis was written, I wish to
acknowledge my obligation and to express my sincere appreciation for
his guidance and advice.

CHAPTER I

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY


“The emotional literature of a people,” wrote one of the greatest of
the Southern poets, William Gilmore Simms,[1] “is as necessary to the
philosophic historian as the mere detail of events in the progress of a
nation.... The mere facts in a history do not always or often indicate
the true _animus_ of the action. But in poetry and song the emotional
nature is apt to declare itself without reserve ... speaking out with
a passion which disdains subterfuge, and through media of imagination
and fancy, which are not only without reserve, but which are too
coercive in their own nature, too arbitrary in their own influence, to
acknowledge any restraint upon that expression which glows or weeps
with emotions that gush freshly and freely from the heart.”

Edmund Clarence Stedman[2] put the matter a little differently.
Asking what may constitute the significance of any body of rhythmical
literature, restricted to its own territory, he answered the question
thus: “Undoubtedly and first of all, the essential quality of its
material as poetry; next to this, its quality as an expression and
interpretation of the time itself. In many an era, the second factor
may afford a surer means of estimate than the first, inasmuch as the
purely literary result may be nothing rarer than the world already has
possessed, nor greatly differing from it: nevertheless it may be the
voice of a time, of a generation, of a people ... all of extraordinary
import to the world’s future.”

“Our own poetry,” he continues elsewhere,[3] “excels as a recognizable
voice in utterance of the emotions of a people. The storm and stress
of youth have been upon us, and the nation has not lacked its lyric
cry.... One who underrates the significance of our literature, prose
or verse, as both the expression and the stimulant of national feeling,
as of import in the past and to the future of America, is deficient in
that critical insight which can judge even of its own day unwarped by
personal taste or deference to public impression. He shuts his eyes to
the fact that at times, notably throughout the years resulting in the
Civil War, this literature has been a ‘force.’”

That the poetry written in the Confederate States during the days of
the Civil War was a “force” in potency second only to the army in the
field, is a fact that has been too long unnoticed by commentators on
the literature of our country. In the rare cases when its influence was
recognized, its quality has been mistaken, its character misunderstood,
its quantity and volume under-estimated. Due perhaps in part to the
intensity of feeling engendered between victors and vanquished in
the Lost Cause, the darkness of the days following the close of the
war effectively hid from view and kept from national circulation the
verses and songs which the war had produced in the South. This was the
primary cause which prevented them from attaining the universal and
critical appreciation of their value that was the right of so large
and important a movement in the history of American letters. The ruin
of the South financially and economically, prevented her from calling
attention to her own achievement: while the widespread destruction and
dispersal of property, as well as the necessarily ephemeral nature of
many of her publications, offers not the least satisfactory explanation
for the comparative restriction of Southern Civil War verse to the land
whence it sprang.

If, however, to the modern critic these poems and songs are
comparatively unknown, by the Southerner of Civil War days their value
was understood and appreciated to the full. Within a year after war
broke out, early in the days of ’62, at least two definite attempts to
assemble the fast multiplying verses and songs were being made, the
first[4] by Professor Chase and John R. Thompson of Richmond, editor of
the _Southern Field and Fireside_; the second by “Bohemian,” Mr. W. G.
Shepperson, who was a correspondent for the Richmond _Despatch_. The
latter effort resulted, in the spring of ’62, in a volume of “War Songs
of the South,” containing some one hundred and eight poems, and with
the following significant words in the Preface:

“Written contemporaneously with the achievements which they celebrate,
[these poems] possess all the vitality and force of the testimony
of eye-witnesses to a glorious combat, or even of actors in it. The
spontaneous outburst of popular feeling, they give the lie to the
assertion of our enemy that this revolution is the work of politicians
and party leaders alone.

“Through the Poets’ Corner in the newspaper, they have sped their
flight from and to the heart and mind of the people. They showed which
way the wind was blowing when the war arose ‘a little cloud like a
man’s hand,’ and black as the heavens may now appear, they bravely sing
above the storm, soaring so high that their wings are brightened by the
sun behind the clouds.

“They cannot fail to challenge the attention of the philosophic
historian by their origin, and their influence.... In every age,
martial songs have wrought wonders in struggles for national
independence.

“And surely these newspaper waifs have played no unimportant part in
the actual drama which surrounds us....

“A single volume of ordinary size cannot contain a tithe of the songs
which have already appeared, and are daily appearing. This, however,
offers enough to show that during the present eventful period, what
was said of the early Spaniard is true of the Southron: ‘He has been
unconsciously surrounding history with the light of imagination,
linking great names with great deeds, concentrating those universal
recollections in which everyone feels he has a part, and silently
building up the fabric of national poetry on the basis of national
enthusiasm.’”

Fifty years later another Southerner, William Malone Baskerville,[5]
wrote this: “A young Marylander, a stripling just from college, was
dreaming dreams from which he was awakened by the guns of Sumter. One
sleepless night in April, 1861, he wrote the poem, ‘My Maryland,’ which
may not inaptly be called the first note of the new Southern literature
... ‘new in strength, new in depth, new in the largest elements of
beauty and truth.’ He that had ears to hear might have heard in the
booming of those guns not only the signal for a gigantic contest, but
also the proclamation of the passing away of the old order, and along
with it the waxflowery, amateurish and sentimental race of Southern
writers.” The passing of this school, of course, meant the passing
of what usually has been recognized as the typical literary mode of
the South. It meant, however, much more than this: for the changing
order was made possible only by the passing of the particular type of
civilization that had fostered it, and this, in its turn indicated a
complete and thorough renaissance not only of life and letters, but
also of Southern soul and spirit.

The type of civilization that endured in the South, to the days of the
Civil War, was one of the most picturesque periods of society that can
be imagined, but not one that induced or encouraged serious literature.
In the North, on the other hand, where there were to be found many
large cities as centres of population, and the great national colleges,
literature had developed with the people. The earliest settlers of
New England had been of a religious, thoughtful, and philosophical
disposition, and their manners and mode of life had served to
strengthen these tendencies in their descendants. Even the climate
of the country had a marked influence in emphasizing New England’s
bent towards literature. Rigorous winters and inclement temperatures
led to long enforced periods of indoor life, conducive to study and
reflection. The effort and stress required to wring a living from
the stubborn soil made them an active and a vigorous people. At the
same time the comparatively small size of their territory, the number
of their towns and cities and the ease of travel over the hard and
rocky roads brought them much in contact with each other, and insured
communication of thought. Theirs was a civilization founded on civil
ties. Farms were small, cultivated usually by the family of the owners,
with a few “hired help,” and centered about the smaller villages and
townships, which in their turn were satellites of the towns. The
towns, again, clustered around the cities, which were thus as hubs in
the wheels of society. The rising individual graduated from the town
to the city, where were gathered the leading spirits and forces of
the day. From the cities back to the smaller communities returned the
great newspapers and magazines, whose spiritual and mental authority
went unchallenged, and which served the more to amalgamate into a
living thoughtful whole the inhabitants of the farthest corner of the
countryside. For everyone life was hard and plain; and there followed
the accepted corollary of high and resolute thought.

In the South, the thought unquestionably was as grave and lofty. It
was, however, neither in the hands of the people, as a whole, nor so
thoroughly co-ordinated into an entity. This lack of centralization
and unity arose from the very order of society, and was at once its
destruction, its charm, and its misfortune. In the first place, as
regards its territory in comparison with the North, there were few
large cities, and these were far apart. From Richmond to Charleston
and New Orleans as the crow flies is nearly three times the distance
from Boston to Philadelphia. In the days of postillions, and in the
later days of steamboats and railroads, a warm damp climate made travel
tedious and tiresome. Neither did the large cities occupy the positions
of importance of their Northern rivals. Because of the fertile soil,
fair climate and multiplicity of laborers the financial and political
power of the country was to be found quite as often among the owners
of the great plantations, as in the counting rooms or law offices of
the metropolis. For various reasons, there were no great and powerful
publishing houses, or influential magazines in general circulation,
the newspaper taking these places. Another factor there was also,
that was especially disintegrating for society at large. Before the
war, education in the South was not universal. For about half the
population, the women were educated at home, or in the case of the
well-to-do, at seminaries and boarding schools. The men, as in the old
Colonial days, had their private tutors, and were then sent to the
Universities at home or abroad, and to travel. But for the mass of
the poorer people, there was little to be had beyond the rudiments of
training: and for many years the University of Virginia was the only
educational institution below the line, which was the academic equal of
the Northern colleges. Education here, as everywhere in the South, was
along purely classic lines, which trained the people to find authority
in the past, and which tended to create a lack of sympathy with
problems other than those immediately concerning the public polity.
Hence it was that the intellectual relationships of the North were
exchanged in the South for social ties; which proved in times of stress
more powerful and unifying than those beyond the Line, and which made
possible, later on, the sympathetic consolidation and confederacy of
the States at the first minute of invasion. In that instant, they were
“a band of brothers,” in a common fellowship and interest: and thus it
was that the very conditions militating against their literature and
literary progress before the War, became in 1861, at once their allies
in the field, and on Parnassus.

It is undeniable that the literary history of the antebellum South
could brook no comparison with that of the North. An agricultural
people such as the Southerners were, are apt to live their lyrics
and romances, rather than write them. Her greatest novelists, Simms
and Kennedy and John Esten Cooke, had given her quiet old-fashioned
historical or pseudo-historical tales after the pattern of Sir Walter
Scott. Today these seem curiously dull and prosy, and more so when
placed in comparison with the extraordinarily ornate and grotesque
Gothic romances of her women writers. That style of fiction of which
Mrs. Hentz, Mrs. Southworth and Miss Evans were the representative
authors may only be described as unreal and utterly false in tone
and color. It is sensational to a degree, but its popularity was in
proportion to its lack of artistic conception. Further than this, what
was true of her prose, was true of her verse. Just as the fiction of
the South was an echo of earlier modes, so her chief lyrists wrote in
the manner of the cavaliers. On the whole, the Southern character had
seemed better adapted to the practice of politics and the management
of plantations, than to government in the province of literature.
Southerners wrote easily and gracefully, but without the sincerity and
beauty that arise from perfect sympathy between the craftsman and his
craft.

It was when a great emotion had thrilled the heart of the South, and
her spirit kindled to a single mighty flame in the prosecution of a
cause on which she could unite all her energies, that the artificiality
of her literature dropped away, and was replaced by strength of
color, truth of outline and power of expression. Before the terror of
civil war, the horror of invasion, and the indignity of submission to
what she deemed a false interpretation of the Constitution and the
principles of Liberty for which her fathers had fought, the literature
of the South lost its superficiality, its romantic characteristics.
From the earliest days of the war, prose in the form of history,
philosophical essays and controversial debate, became the recognized
and powerful weapon wielded by her greatest minds: while poetry, in
the hands alike of poet and peasant, became the great national organ
for emotional expression.

Fully to appreciate the themes and refrains that filled her war verse,
it is necessary to understand for just what principles, and with what
a temper, the South began the fight. Whatever had been the immediate
excuse for war, for the Southerner the conflict very quickly resolved
itself into a struggle for liberty. The principle of States’ Rights
had always been cherished in the South since the days of the Articles
of Confederation, in 1781, which declared at the very onset that
while adopting this plan that was designed to make of the various
integers a government that might be per se recognizable,--“each state
retained its sovereignty, freedom and independence.” “Submission to
any encroachment, the least as well as the greatest, on the rights of
a state means slavery,” wrote Dr. Basil Gildersleeve.[6] “The extreme
Southern States considered this right menaced by the issue of the
presidential election.” The South had always clung to the earlier
conception of national union of separate and independent units. That
the North regarded her as a rebel against the Constitution of her
fathers but goaded her the more bitterly, who felt that above all
things she battled in the right, for the freedom of which Washington
himself had dreamed, and which her own ancestors had been the greater
part of the instrument in winning and perfecting. It was therefore to
the South a holy contest. “Right or wrong, we were fully persuaded in
our own minds, and there was no lurking suspicion of any moral weakness
in our cause,” continued Dr. Gildersleeve.[7] “Nothing could be holier
than the cause, nothing more imperative than the duty of upholding it.
There were those in the South who when they saw the issue of the War,
gave up their faith in God, but not their faith in the cause.”

With Lincoln’s decision to provision Fort Sumter, on April 1, 1861,
and his call for troops, two weeks later, the question of States’
Rights was amplified by the addition of two other sentiments which
three together formed the lofty inspiration that, in the South lifted
the struggle above the commonplaces of civil strife. At once it
was dignified into a war in defence of home, of native land, and of
liberty. It was therefore with a certain nobility of purpose that the
Confederate Army went forth to battle. The North had enlisted on a
punitive expedition: the South had engaged in a crusade for her ideals.
This was the magic touch that transmuted the comparative dross of her
literature to pure gold. “When there flashed upon poetic souls not the
political issues that were at stake, but the great human situation
of the struggle, they gave voice to the pent up feelings of the new
nation.”

The poetic genius of the Southerners had always been lyric in
character, partly as the result of environment, partly that of racial
temper, partly as an inheritance from the old Cavaliers who had been
their ancestors. Nor had the lyrists of the South been of slender
numbers. Professor Manly’s “Southern Literature” credits the land
with over two hundred poets whom he considered worthy of mention.
More than fifty of these belong to Virginia alone, and Dr. Painter
wrote[8] of their work that “examination ... reveals among a good deal
that is commonplace and imitative, many a little gem that ought to be
preserved.” Their method was usually Byronic and amorous. They had,
it is true, made little or no use of local color or legend, and had
given over the narrative and the dramatic for the lyric. Their work,
however, was always melodious and of easy numbers. This was their
particular characteristic. The second, and indeed the more interesting,
was the lack of the professional touch. Before the War, there had been
few vocational poets, as there had been few professed _literateurs_.
Poetry was the possession of the many, not of a small group of favored
ones, and these wrote purely for the pleasure of the art, with so
little care for fame or reputation that many of their verses still
remain uncollected. When, therefore, the emotion of the conflict was
borne upon the South, there were poets to fight her battles--just as
there were soldiers in the field,--who were using an accustomed mode,
though with unaccustomed sincerity and felicity. Indeed, the number of
war poets is one of the amazing phenomena of the time: and as in the
North, literature was mainly in their hands. Beyond the line there were
Longfellow, Whittier, Lowell, Emerson, Holmes, Boker, Whitman and Mrs.
Stowe. In the South, Hayne, Timrod, Ticknor, Simms, John R. Thompson,
George Bagby, Dr. Holcombe, Mrs. Preston, Mrs. Charles, and Father Ryan
filled roles as lofty, and as surely inspired. There was, however,
this difference in their work. The poets of the North lived and wrote
in comparative security and remoteness from the field. Their verses
were characterized by a virtuous indignation against the rebellion, by
appeals for men, anger at constant delay and unnecessary defeat, and
deliberate exhortations in the name of the Union.

In the South, on the other hand, conditions were quite different. The
whole land was a battle field, which every man, woman and child was
bound by his principles to defend with his very life, and from which
they had pledged themselves to drive the invading hordes. Each soul
was personally involved in the conflict, and the poets, instead of
looking on the struggle from afar, and distantly applauding it, looked
out from the very centres of confusion, calling to their people words
of help and cheer and courage. Theirs was not a plea to engage in the
conflict. Theirs was the shout of “Come to the battle! Help us or we
perish, and with us the sacred fires of true and personal Freedom.” It
was the “terrible experience of a mighty conflict,[9] in which the soul
of the people was ... brought out through struggles, passion, partings,
heroism, love, death, ... all effective in the production of genuine
feeling and the development of real character. While the battles were
being fought in the homes of the Southerners, their poets sent forth
now a stirring martial lyric, now a humorous song or poem recounting
the trials and hardships of camp, hospital and prison life ... these
becoming ever more and more intermingled with dirges for Jackson, for
Albert Sidney Johnston, for Stuart, for Ashby, and finally for the
Conquered Banner. In all these there was no trace of artificiality, no
sign of the mawkish sentimentality of the old waxflowery, amateurish
and sentimental race of Southern writers.... They were surcharged
with deep, genuine, sincere feeling. They were instinct with life. In
this respect the war poetry laid the foundation of the new Southern
literature ... ‘new in strength, new in depth, new in the largest
elements of beauty and truth.’”

It was a terrible price to pay for a renaissance of art, wrung as
it was from the heart of a wounded people. It appeared still more a
vain and useless sacrifice because at first the Southern war poetry
gave rise to no literary genre. Indirectly, however, in its return to
reality, to simplicity of emotion and truth of passion, this war verse
was of inestimable value to the rising school of Southern fiction and
prose. Nevertheless, the renaissance could not come at once. It was
only when the pain and ruin of war had somewhat passed, and the South
had begun to recover from the waste which the conflict had wrought on
the land, when the bitterness of the struggle had softened with the
changing years and generations, and after the new attitude towards life
had had time to crystalize into permanency, that one of her younger
poets could write of her, with truth:[10]

  Lo! from the war cloud, dull and dense,
      Loyal and chaste and brave and strong
  Comes forth the South with frankincense,
      And vital freshness in her song.
  The weight is fallen from her wings,
  To find a purer air she springs
  Out of the night, into the morn.




CHAPTER II

THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTHERN WAR POETRY


Contemporary criticism is seldom safely to be trusted, but there
are times when contemporaneous comment is as valuable as it is
enlightening. It is so with this statement by T. C. de Leon--in his
introduction to an anthology of the Southern Civil War verse.[11]
“If poems born of revolution bore no marks of the bitter need that
crushed them from the hearts of their authors, they would have no value
whatever, intrinsic or historical.”

Southern war poetry is worthy of preservation because it is an
expression of vital appeal and of sentiment wrung from the heart of
a people. For the most part, it was written under the stress of the
moment. It was indeed the spontaneous overflow of powerful emotion, but
only occasionally does it take its origin from emotion recollected in
tranquillity. Nevertheless, it speaks the language of men and women,
and in it we may read, as perhaps through no other medium, the true
story of the development of Southern character, of national spirit, and
of definite sectional consciousness.

Today the poetry remains to us in the newspapers and magazines of the
period, and in the anthologies and various collections of war verse
(the best of these appearing either during the war or shortly after).
Most interesting, but most ephemeral of them all, it remains in part in
the small printed broadsides, or single sheets in handbill form, which
usually appeared anonymously and mysteriously, at times even without
the name of the printer. Issued in varying numbers, on wretched paper,
and seldom gathered together, so many of these have perished in the
passage of the years, that in many instances a single copy may remain
in existence. Of the verses that circulated in MSS. there is now little
trace. Occasionally, as in the case of K--s “To the Memory of Stonewall
Jackson,” some old copy-book or diary will restore them to the light:
but of the various sources, less result is obtained from this field
than from the others.

Next to the appearance of the poems in the papers and journals,
publication by broadside was probably the most common usage. Especially
in the later days of the war, when newspaper publication was either
temporarily or entirely suspended, this medium insured the quickest
distribution of verse particularly applicable to the moment, a battle
ode, a dirge of a fallen leader, or a song of peculiarly inspiriting
phraseology. It was in this broadside form that “My Maryland” spread
through the South almost in a day, anonymously, and often suffering
from lines badly copied or cut. That Randall was the author was a fact
silently understood and communicated: for it was safest and wisest in
those early days, and particularly in the border states, that names
be not mentioned. Even later, and after months of war, this condition
still obtained. The appearance, in September, 1862, of “Stonewall
Jackson’s Way,” written by Dr. John Williamson Palmer, as he listened
to the guns of Sharpsburg, is a case in point. Dr. Palmer gives this
history of the poem, and its publication:[12]

“In September, 1862, I found myself ... at Oakland ... in Garrett
County, Maryland. Early on the sixteenth there was a roar of guns in
the air, and we knew that a great battle was toward ... I knew that
Stonewall was in it, whatever it might be: it was his way,--‘Stonewall
Jackson’s Way.’ I had twice put that phrase into my war letters, and
other correspondents, finding it handy, had quoted it in theirs. I
paced the piazza and whistled a song of Oregon lumbermen and loggers
that I had learned from a California adventurer in Honolulu. The two
thoughts were coupled and welded into one to make a song: and as the
words gathered to the call of the tune I wrote the ballad of ‘Stonewall
Jackson’s Way’ with the roar of these guns in my ears. On the morrow I
added the last stanza....

“In Baltimore I told the story of the song to my father, and at his
request made immediately another copy of it. This was shown cautiously
to certain members of the Maryland Club: and a trusty printer was
found who struck off a dozen slips of it, principally for private
distribution. That first printed copy of the song was headed ‘Found on
a Rebel Sergeant of the Old Stonewall Brigade, Taken at Winchester.’
The fabulous legend was for the misleading of the Federal provost
marshal, as were also the address and date, ‘Martinsburg, September 13,
1862.’”

It must not be supposed that this war verse which has survived to
our day consists merely of battle songs and popular ballads on
themes arising from the nature of the conflict. Just as the war was
far reaching and general in its effect, touching every Southerner
personally, and too often poignantly, so the poetic response was varied
and modified to meet the demand of the moment. There is description,
and narration; there are of course dialectics and polemics; there is
satire; and there is even a little humor. And because through all this
rings the personal and individual appeal, the prevailing note is lyric.
Of the dramatic there is very little, notably Hayne’s “The Substitute,”
and “The Royal Ape.” This last is a long dramatic narrative in iambic
pentameter rimed couplets that is possibly more interesting as satire
and propaganda than as pure drama. Yet neither of these is a work of
free inspiration. The Southern war poet did his best work when out of
the fulness of his heart, he either vowed allegiance to his beloved
land, and her leaders, or wrote in passion and defiance as a resolved
defender of the freedom of his Fathers.

Judged from an emotional point of view, this poetry falls into three
distinct periods, obvious enough in themselves, but interesting
in that by them we may see more clearly the issues of the war as
reflected in the hearts of the warriors. There are the first poems of
rebellion against oppression: lyrics of passionate defiance as well as
of hortatory counsel: appeals to remember the glory of the past and
the danger of the present. The second period started at the moment
of invasion after which there was no longer need for a Congress to
formulate the principles for which they fought, or to arrange for the
unifying of the various State integers. Then began the poetry of actual
conflict, taking the form of verses concerning particular battles, the
narration of some heroic deed, the lament for a great hero, as well
as camp ballads, and marching songs. As a connecting link with the
first period, there are still the poems breathing the national spirit,
and loyalty to the Southern cause. Even in the third and last period,
that of disappointment, discouragement and actual defeat, this note
continues, and is the more poignant for its unfaltering persistence in
the face of calamity.

The poetry of the first period began in the closing days of 1860. In
November of that year there had been elected by the North and West a
President whose principles of government seemed to threaten the South
with danger of extermination of her most precious interests. The
platform of Republicanism she considered in every respect inimical to
her importance as a unit in the central organization of states. Her
very identity was endangered, and that to a section where pride of
historic heritage was as dear as actual power of wealth and commerce,
aroused her as could perhaps nothing else. Therefore, on December
twentieth, 1860, South Carolina passed her order of secession,
following it with the “Declaration of Independence,” which justified
the previous action by recalling the two great principles asserted by
the early colonies, namely, “the right of a state to govern itself,
and the right of a people to abolish a government when it becomes
destructive to the ends for which it was instituted. And concurrent
with the establishment of these principles was the fact that each
colony became and was recognized by the mother country as a free,
sovereign and independent state.” It was a proud imperious challenge,
and made immediate appeal to every Southerner to whom freedom and
independence, personal or otherwise, was a precious birthright. The
proclamation fired the imagination, as it did the poetic spirit of the
land: the poetic response struck the same note. S. Henry Dickson’s
“South Carolina” was one of the first poems to appear. Its verses are
as lofty in tone as the lines of the proclamation, and equally as
sincere. They are frankly exultant.

  The deed is done! the die is cast;
  The glorious Rubicon is passed:
  Hail, Carolina! free at last.

  Strong in the right I see her stand
  Where ocean laves the shelving sand;
  Her own Palmetto decks the strand.

  She turns aloft her flashing eye;
  Radiant, her lonely star on high
  Shines clear against the darkening sky.

         *       *       *       *       *

  Fling forth her banner to the gale!
  Let all the hosts of earth assail,--
  Their fury and their force shall fail.

         *       *       *       *       *

  Oh, land of heroes! Spartan State!
  In numbers few, in daring great,
  Thus to affront the frown of fate!

  And while mad triumph rules the hour,
  And thickening clouds of menace lower,
  Bear back the tide of tyrant power.

  With steadfast courage, faltering never,
  Sternly resolved, her bonds to sever:
  Hail, Carolina! free forever!

This may be the expression of the hour, but it proved as well to be
the poetic sentiment of the next four years. Every poet of the South,
from the humblest maker of camp catches to the greatest of her lyrists,
shared this attitude of resolve, as they watched their Spartan nation
continue to wage what they consented to be a righteous war for freedom,
against a tyrant power. Naturally, expression became more sharply
crystalized with the actual invasion. None the less, even thus early,
before the end of ’60, we have a precise foreshadowing of the war
attitude of the Confederate poet.

With the passage of secession in South Carolina, at once the remaining
“Cotton States” were torn by the conflict of making a great decision.
There were those to whom the indignity of submitting their conception
of government to what they called a usurpation of authority was
inconceivable treachery to an ancient and honorable past: and there
were those to whom unquestioning obedience to the Government at
Washington was the only way of fulfilling the heritage of their
ancestors. In the end, the extremists won. The North would offer no
compromise: indeed, it would have been contrary to the Southern code
of honor to have accepted halfway measures. To them there appeared no
other course to pursue, no solution but to follow Carolina’s lordly
lead. Mississippi seceded on January ninth, Florida on the tenth,
Alabama on the eleventh, Georgia on the nineteenth, Louisiana on the
twenty-sixth.

For the South as a whole, as well as for her poets, January had been a
month of tempest. Following the secession of Carolina, the situation
that had developed over Fort Sumter was dangerous to the extreme.
As it afterwards proved, Sumter was the tinder which kindled the
flame of war; and as early as January, when Major Anderson refused to
surrender the fort the menace within the South began to show itself.
The authorities of Charleston, endangered by Federal possession of
Sumter, demanded its surrender. No decision could have been reached
until after March fourth, when Lincoln was inaugurated. Meanwhile,
on the fourth of February, the six states which had already left the
Union, and Texas, which seceded three days earlier, formally met at
convention in Charleston, and united in a Confederacy, in opposition to
the Government at Washington. It was a move which their poets, as well
as their more practically visioned men, had been frantically urging.
Two of the most interesting of the poems of this period appeared,
the one in the _Southern Literary Messenger_ for January, by William
Gilmore Simms, the other in the _Charleston Courier_, about the middle
of the month, addressed in French, by R. Thomassy, under date of
Nouvelle Orleans, 2 Janvier 1861, to “Les Enfants du Sud.” It is fiery
and eloquent of passion.

  Enfants du Sud, l’outrage et la menace
      Aux nobles coeurs ne laissent plus de choix.
  Le paix nous trompe: un serpent nous enlace
      Tranchons ses noeuds, et defendons nos droits!
  Qu’attendrons--nous pour reprendre l’epee,
      Qui triompha d’un vieux monde oppresseur?
  Le nord aussi, violant la foi juree,
      Seme a son tour discorde et deshonneur.
  Aux armes donc pour la cause sacree;
      De nos ayeux vengeons les saintes lois;
  Nous sommes Sparte, invincible, eprouvee;
      Que sa vertu preside a nos exploits!

Gilmore Simms’ poem is less a call to arms, and more a warm and
affectionate tribute to a beloved land, noteworthy because it proves
that even before the Confederacy was formed, the people of the South
were united in her love. The second stanza is better than the first.

  She is all fondness to her friends: to foes
      She glows a thing of passion, strength and pride;
  She feels no tremors when the danger’s nigh,
      But the fight over, and the victory won,
  How with strange fondness turns her loving eye
      In tearful welcome on each gallant son!

         *       *       *       *       *

  I glory that my lot with her is cast,
      And my soul flushes and exultant sings;

Already there had begun the actual war verse, taking here the form
of the invitation to arms. That war, the “irrepressible conflict,”
was inevitable, was recognized by all sensible men. “Barhamville” in
January addressed one of the first of these, “The Call,” to the editor
of the _South Carolinian_. At this time, too, there appeared the fervid
“Spirit of ’60,” in the Columbus _Times_, forerunner of a series in
which were contrasted the spirit of the present and of ’76. To the
South, both were wars for liberty, both struggles against oppression,
in both contests the South was a vital factor; and the analogy was too
good for a poetic eye to miss.

The finest single poem produced in this preliminary stage of the
contest was that by Henry Timrod, “Ethnogenesis,” written during the
meeting of the first Southern Congress, at Montgomery, in the early
days of February. To the poet the Congress meant indeed the birth of a
great nation, a nation among nations, strong in its right, and secure
in national resource,

      “marshalled by the Lord of Hosts
  And overshadowed by the mighty ghosts
  Of Moultrie and of Eutaw.”

It is a noble utterance and its dignity and melody of expression must
have added greatly to the deep impression it created. In the _Southern
Literary Messenger_ for the month there are Joseph Brennan’s “Ballad
for the Young South”--“Men of the South! our foes are up, in fierce and
grim array,”--and the defiant “The Southland Fears No Foeman,” by J. W.
M., in which is the richly suggestive line, “Her eagles yet are free;”
while “from the Georgia papers,” under date of Atlanta, February first,
there is the anonymous “Cotton States’ Farewell to Yankee Doodle.” This
latter is especially interesting because it is one of the first of a
“Farewell to Brother Jonathan” group which enjoyed considerable vogue
during the late winter and which was answered in the North by Oliver
Wendell Holmes, with the lines “Brother Jonathan’s Lament for Sister
Caroline,” under date of March 25. Of the Confederate poems on this
theme, “Farewell to Brother Jonathan” by “Caroline,” which appeared
about this time seems closely connected with Holmes’ verses. The metre
of the two poems is the same and the thought antithetic, although
it would be difficult to determine which is the reply. The last two
stanzas of “Farewell to Brother Jonathan” are particularly good.

  O Brother! beware how you seek us again,
  Lest you brand on your forehead the signet of Cain;
  That blood and that crime on your conscience must sit;
  We may fail, we may perish, but never submit!

  The pathway that leads to the Pharisee’s door
  We remember, indeed, but we tread it no more;
  Preferring to turn, with the Publican’s faith,
  To the path through the valley and shadow of death.

Three other poems, apparently of this month, should be mentioned in
passing, as exemplifying the note of personal interest of the Southern
poet in the issue of the struggle. Robert Joselyn’s “Gather! Gather!”
the anonymous war song, “Come, Brothers! You are called!” and Millie
Mayfield’s triumphant “We Come! We Come!” may not be poetry of the
first order: nevertheless these are verses written by people to whom
the threatened conflict is not a matter distant and aloof, but of
intimate and vital concern.

March was a month of little action on both sides. In the North it
witnessed the inauguration of Lincoln; in the South the completer
organizing and unification of the Confederacy, and the beginning of
negotiations by the Confederacy by which they might secure possession
of Fort Sumter. If, however, the South was marking time, her poets were
not. They continued to urge her on to fulfillment of her “destiny.”
Indeed, this month saw written some of the very best and most resolute
of her war verse. There is the indignant “Coercion,” by John C.
Thompson--

  “Who talks of Coercion? Who dares to deny
      A resolute people the right to be free?”

There is the anonymous “Prosopopeia,” also in the _Southern Literary
Messenger_, which with Timrod’s “Cry to Arms,” written a little later,
is the best of the verse of this kind which the period produced.
Another widely known poem of the month was St. George Tucker’s “The
Southern Cross,” verses patterned after Key’s “Star Spangled Banner,”
and which had enormous vogue, and was even set to music, later on. This
in so far as can be determined is the first poetic use of the Southern
Cross as the symbol of the Confederacy, a figure that was later adopted
for the design of her flag, and which finally became, not only her
ensign, but as well a symbol of the righteousness of her faith and
cause. James Barron Hope’s “Oath of Freedom,”--

  Born free, thus we resolve to live:
      By Heaven, we will be free.
  By all the stars which burn on high,
  By the green earth--the mighty sea--
  By God’s unshaken majesty
      We will be free or die!--

is of a kind with Thompson’s “Coercion,” and was widely copied during
this time. Another poem must be mentioned here, as presaging the
turmoil to follow, “Fort Sumter,” by “H.,” in the New Orleans _Delta_,
with the command of its refrain, “Carolina, _take_ the Fort.”

The most eventful months of the year 1861 were April and July, for
April inaugurated “the irrepressible conflict,” and July saw the first
great battle of the war, and a complete Confederate victory. On the
first of April, President Lincoln announced his decision to refuse
surrender of Fort Sumter to the Confederates, and added that he would
undertake to provision the garrison imprisoned there immediately. At
once the South was aflame. On the morning of the twelfth of April,
Beauregard, commander of the Southern forces at Charleston, ordered
the shelling of the Fort, which continued through the thirteenth, and
ended with the evacuation of the Fort on the fourteenth. The war had
begun, and though the opening engagement had been without loss to
either side, and had ended in a Confederate victory, a far bloodier and
disastrous conflict was inevitable. To the rejoicing South, however,
there was only the glory of the first decision to consider, and the
poets in their rapture gave utterance to a sheaf of verse, innumerable
ballads about Sumter, affectionate odes to the nation so gloriously
born and baptized by victorious fire, two great national songs, and
frantic appeals to North Carolina, Virginia and Maryland, Tennessee and
Kentucky to join fortunes of the Confederacy.

The first song published in the South after the war began, and
corresponding, in the North, to E. C. Stedman’s “The Twelfth of April”
was, fittingly enough, “God Save the South” by George H. Miles of
Frederick County, Maryland. Sung to music by C. W. A. Ellerbrock, it
was designed to be, and accepted as the national hymn. It did not
however, succeed in becoming a favorite. On the twenty-sixth of the
month, James Rider Randall, inflamed by the circumstances of the
“Baltimore Massacre” on April nineteenth, wrote his “My Maryland,” the
most famous Southern poem produced by the war, and one whose influence
was greater than a hundred battles. Circulated at first by broadsides
it swept through the South like wildfire, and if any force could have
drawn Maryland to the side of the Confederacy, it would have been that
exerted by this poem. Her Union Governor, however, aided by Federal
troops and tactful advice from Washington, succeeded in holding the
State to the Union, although many Marylanders were ardent Southern
sympathizers. Virginia, on the other hand, who, like Maryland, had been
hesitating over her decision, hesitated no longer, after the episode
of Sumter, implying as it did, Federal coercion. On the seventeenth
of April she seceded from the Union. Her “pausing” had long been
considered a shame and a reproach by Southern poets. Now, they burst
forth in delight. “Virginia, Late But Sure!” was the triumphant shout
of Dr. Holcombe, and Virginia’s answer was expressed in poems such as
“Virginia to the Rescue,” “Virginia’s Rallying Call,” or “Virginia’s
Message to the Southern States.”

The poetry produced or published in May chiefly concerns the decision
of Virginia, and the assembling of the Southern armies, those “Ordered
Away” to the field. Virginia’s entrance into the Confederacy had burnt
all the bridges leading back--though remotely--to peace. At once the
South proceeded to rally her forces to the standard of her cause,
and gradually during May and June, flung out her battle line across
Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky to the Mississippi. Down the
river it stretched through Forts Henry and Donelson to New Orleans. At
one time, in ’63, the Confederate line surged forward through Western
Virginia and Maryland so far into Pennsylvania that Harrisburg was
directly menaced. It was the four years’ uncertain task of the Union
forces to control this line, to break through it, turn it back and
in upon itself, and finally to starve its scattered remnants into
submission. As this was accomplished the first lyric outburst of the
War--Timrod’s “Cry to Arms,” for example--was gradually exchanged for
a slenderer volume of song. At first her poets encouraged the people
to faith and labor; then they sang of hope and courage, attempting to
relieve the despair of a nation whose cause was lost, and whose ruin
seemed irretrievable.

In the spring of ’61, however, there was only exultation, while in the
North the cry of “On to Richmond” welled and grew fiercer during May,
June and the summer months. Especially did it grow imperative after
July twentieth, when the Confederate Capital was transferred there from
Montgomery. On the next day, July twenty-first, came the great opening
battle of the war, when the Union army under General Scott, joined
with Beauregard’s men at Manassas Junction. The result was a complete
Confederate victory, and there was unrestricted panic and flight among
the Federal troops (the source of much satiric comment among the
Southern poets) when Joseph E. Johnston’s army, which had not been
expected to arrive until too late to be of assistance to Beauregard,
appeared at the crucial moment.

It was only natural that the wave of triumphant exultation which had
thrilled the South after the fall of Sumter should again sweep the
land. Her poets responded with a sheaf of poems, in which they wrote
of the contest from every angle,--odes of thanksgiving for victory,
narratives of the course of the flight, eulogies of Beauregard and
Johnston, satires on the behavior of the Union forces, camp catches
half satiric and half comic, poems of particular incidents of the
fight, finally words of regret and sorrow for the slain, and the manner
of their slaying. This last theme is particularly interesting, for the
feeling of horror at the situation “where brother fought with brother”
was ever-present with the Southerners throughout the four years of
the War. The very best of the poems occasioned by Manassas were those
of Mrs. Warfield, “Manassas,” Susan Archer Talley’s “Battle Eve,”
Ticknor’s “Our Left,” and the lines by “Ruth,” entitled “The Battle of
Bull Run,” dated Louisville, Kentucky, July twenty-fourth, and written
in curious and effective stanzas of irregular “unrhymed rhythms.” Mrs.
Warfield’s poem was stirring and vigorous, bold in metaphor and in
expression.

  They have met at last, as storm clouds
          Meet in Heaven,
  And the Northmen, back and bleeding
          Have been driven:
  And their thunders have been stilled,
  And their leaders crushed or killed,
  And their ranks, with terror thrilled
          Rent and riven!

  Like the leaves of Vallumbroso
          They are lying;
  In the moonlight, in the midnight
          Dead and dying:
  Like those leaves before the gale
  Swept their legions wild and pale,
  While the host that made them quail
          Stood, defying.

         *       *       *       *       *

  But peace to those who perished
          In our passes!
  Light be the earth above them!
          Green the grasses!
  Long shall Northmen rue the day,
  When they met our stern array,
  And shrunk from battle’s wild affray
          At Manassas.

Miss Talley’s “Battle Eve,” with its beautiful picture of twilight
calm before the darker night of storm and death, is affecting in its
simple direct appeal, and sincerity of regret for the carnage of
conflict--and was called forth by the seriousness of the impending
meeting at Manassas. Francis Orray Ticknor’s “Our Left”--suggested
by the indomitable courage and perseverance of the Confederate left
wing before McDowell’s men, until reinforced by the timely arrival
of Johnston’s army, who brought victory with them, is a spirited,
almost exalted account of the actual battle, and was immensely
popular at the time. There are many versions of it still extant, in
broadsides and anthologies,--for the most part anonymous, since the
poem evidently was not at first acknowledged by Ticknor. This has led
to a curious connection of names. In one of the broadsides versions
in the collection of the Ridgway Library, in Philadelphia, the poem
is dated Baltimore, Maryland, October 20, 1861, and is signed by “Old
Secesh.” This signature is also given to “The Despot’s Song,” a popular
Lincoln satire of a later period of the War, which again is assigned to
Baltimore, and from circumstantial evidence seems to be the work of Dr.
N. G. Ridgely, a Baltimorean who was a popular satirist of the day, and
who signed his work variously “N. G. R.,” “Le Diable Baiteux,” “O. H.
S.,” “Cola,” and “B.” This last signature is further associated with
the name of James Ryder Randall, for in the Baltimore City Librarian’s
Office, in Ledger 1411, there is a broadside version of “Maryland, My
Maryland,” published in Baltimore, as were these other broadsides, and
signed “B,” Point Coupee (La.), April 26, 1861. It would, of course,
be impossible, so many years later, to puzzle out the interrelation of
the poems and signatures, and indeed their value would hardly warrant
the labor. It is, nevertheless, an interesting example of the chaos
which at times arose from the necessarily surreptitious publication and
circulation of the Confederate verse.

Manassas was the last great event of the year. There were several minor
engagements between the two armies, notably the fight at Ball’s Bluff,
on the twenty-first of October; and there was the “Trent Affair,”
with the capture of the Confederate emissaries to England, Mason and
Slidell, on November eighth. Nevertheless, the Southern poets did not
lack inspiring material, the continued “aloofness” of Maryland and
Kentucky being among their most vital themes. They were, of course,
never idle with their lyrics of loyalty and continued to sound the war
note or to sing of the South, with indomitable zeal. They had even by
this time, become so accustomed to the state of war, that they could
begin to work seriously with satire. The best in this genre written
in ’61 are John R. Thompson’s “On to Richmond,” satirizing Winfield
Scott’s first campaign, and “England’s Neutrality” (England had passed
a proclamation of neutrality towards the two belligerents early in May,
on the thirteenth): “O Johnny Bull, My Jo John,” an anonymous ballad
occasioned by the presence of English frigates off the coast in ’61,
and the unfortunately anonymous, but delightfully humorous “King Scare”
(prompted by the terror in the North regarding the Confederate power in
the field).

The close of the year was marked by a poem in the _Southern Field
and Fireside_--a “Requiem for 1861,” by H. C. B. It is not of any
particular excellence or poetic merit, but it is worthy of note for its
expression of sincere sorrow for the conflict that was severing a land
of brothers; and for a sense of the horror that war had brought to the
South.

  Year of terror, year of strife,
  Year with evil passions rife
  Pass, with seething angry flood,
  Pass, with garments dipped in blood,--

  Born ’mid hopes, but raised in fears,
  With thy dewdrops changed to tears,
  With thy springtime turned to blight,
  And with darkness quenching light.

         *       *       *       *       *

  War’s fierce tread upon our land
  Severing once a kindred band,
  Child and father ranged for strife,
  Brother seeking brother’s life!

         *       *       *       *       *

  Thou who doth unsheathe the sword
  By the power of Thy Word,
  And can by Thy mighty will
  To the waves say “peace, be still”

  Gather up this storm once more,
  Where “Thy judgments are in store,”
  Send Thy holy dove of Peace,
  And our fettered land release!

The same longing for peace is shown in the verses “Christmas Day, A.
D. 1861,” by M. J. H. But it must be a peace with victory. That was
the earliest conception. By the lives of her sons who had died for her
in the year just passed, the South was resolved on whatever sacrifice
it might cost her to prevail, despite the fact that she was already
weary of the struggle. No better expression of her unchecked purpose
may be found than in Mrs. War field’s lines, written in the spring
months before Manassas, “The Southern Chant of Defiance.” With Timrod’s
“Ethnogenesis,” and Randall’s “Maryland,” it stands the finest poetry
which the year produced in the Confederacy.

1862 began with the Confederacy prevailing. Nevertheless, the first
six months of the year seemed to bring to the South nothing but gloom.
In February of ’62, came news of the capture of Fort Henry on the
Tennessee River, February sixth, and on February eighth, of the fall
of Fort Donelson, on the Cumberland. There was much more importance in
these two defeats than at first appeared to the poets; for these forts
were the two most valuable gateways to the Southwestern Confederacy,
and their fall meant not only the first break in the Confederate line,
but as well, direct menace of Southern control of the Mississippi, and
New Orleans. It foreshadowed the later evacuation of Nashville, before
Grant.

In January, the month before, the chief theme of the Southern poets
had been the meditated burning of the cotton crop, by the Southern
planters, and this cry of “Burn the Cotton!” had brought forth at
least one finely phrased poem. In February, the themes concerned the
siege and evacuation of Donelson, and there began the days of wretched
anxiety that were to possess the Confederacy until the end of July,
when the land was to know that the Virginia part of her line still
held, and Richmond was safe. In March McClellan assumed chief control
of the Union forces, and began his Peninsula campaign, in response to
Lincoln’s reiterated cry, “On to Richmond.” On the eighth of the month,
the Confederate ram “Merrimac” out from Norfolk, succeeded in breaking
the Federal blockade of Hampton Roads, much to the consternation of the
North. The next day, however, in her encounter with the “cheesebox”
Monitor, “the turtle” Merrimac was too badly hurt to be of further
or immediate use, and the elation of the day before gave way to
depression, which was in no way relieved by the events of the next few
months. April saw the practical occupation of the Mississippi, with the
fall of Corinth, the evacuation of Fort Pillow, and on the lower river,
Farragut and Porter’s occupation of New Orleans. Of the Mississippi
line, there remained to the Confederates only Vicksburg and Port
Hudson. For the South everything depended on the defeat of McClellan’s
“On to Richmond” march, since on the sixth of the month, Albert Sidney
Johnston, attempting to retrieve the disaster to the middle line in
Tennessee, had engaged Grant at Shiloh and Pittsburgh Landing, with
tremendous carnage. The battle had proved an incomplete Confederate
defeat, but what was worse for the South, had occasioned Johnston’s
death.

To all of the many events of these opening months, the Southern poets
made continuous response. National songs inspiring faith and courage,
as for example, Hewitt’s “Lines Written During These Gloomy Times, To
Him Who Despairs,” spoken at the Richmond “Varieties” by Mr. Ogden,
Wednesday night, May 7, 1862,--occasional verses suggested by various
incidents and episodes of the war’s progress, camp catches and marching
ballads praising individual troops and regiments, the poets poured
forth in unstinting measure. However, the death of Albert Sidney
Johnston, at Shiloh, made a deeper impression on the poets than any
event of these spring months. The affection and pure love which the
Southerners lavished on their leaders is one of the several remarkable
phenomena of the war. In no other war, and in no other country do the
leaders appear to have been so beloved, so idolized. To us today, the
expression of sentiment seems extravagant and excessive. One attribute
it has, however, and one that is not to be denied. The praise of the
South for her great men is always passionately sincere. During the war,
the Southerners were, as never before, a band of brothers. There was,
therefore, in their relations with their great men, a personal contact
and appeal which in the North was not so keenly felt. Albert Sidney
Johnston, who with Beauregard, had been one of the heroes of Manassas,
was the first of Confederate heroes to fall. The South mourned him, as
she did all of her sons who fell in her defence, truly and warmly.

When “Stonewall” Jackson died, after Chancellorsville, almost a
year later, the outburst of the poets with dirges and elegies was
quite typical. S. A. Link quotes T. C. de Leon, the editor of _South
Songs_ (1866), as saying:[13] “I had in my collection no fewer than
forty-seven monodies and dirges on Stonewall Jackson, some dozen on
Ashby, and a score on Stuart.” Even today there are extant a round
dozen of poems lamenting the death of Albert Sidney Johnston.

With all the sorrow that came to the South in these first months of
depression, it is pleasant to see that she had not lost the saving
humor and satiric sense that was so to strengthen her in the evil
days which followed. On April sixteenth, for example, the Confederate
Congress, alarmed by the condition of the Southern army, passed a
measure for conscription. This was commented upon in the _Southern
Literary Messenger_ for the month, with a delightful epigram:

  Let us hail in this crisis the prosperous omen
  That our senate shows virtue higher than Roman;
  It has spurned all titles of honor, for rather
  Than claim that each member be called “Conscript Father,”
  All self-aggrandizement they lay on the shelves,
  And declare all men conscripts, excepting themselves!

During May and June of ’62 Jackson and Lee endeavored to arrest
McClellan’s progress by their counter campaign in the Shenandoah. For
the South it was a most successful move. Not only were the Southern
arms carried to victory, but, through the unfortunate wounding of
Joseph E. Johnston at Seven Pines, Lee, whose fame had grown in the
Shenandoah, was placed in supreme command of the army of Northern
Virginia. The turning point of the Southern fortunes had arrived. The
battle of the Chickahominy, Malvern Hill, and the Seven Day’s fighting
before Richmond, resulted in the defeat of McClellan’s campaign, and
Richmond, for the next two years, was saved.

The army of the Confederacy, through the hardships and reverses of the
first year of fighting, had become a seasoned and experienced (though,
thanks to the blockade, a sadly ill-equipped) machine. Its three great
leaders were Lee and Jackson and Beauregard. The Southerners at home
were beginning to be accustomed to the privations of war. They were
all as confident as ever of the righteousness of their war. Thus with
a united Confederacy behind him and after another victory at “Second
Manassas,” in ’62, Lee began his ill-starred Maryland campaign, as
a counter-stroke against the Army of the Potomac. Lee’s part of the
Confederate line, the Army of Northern Virginia, was the only part of
the original battle wall still intact. Butler and his forces were in
possession of New Orleans, the fall of Vicksburg, already in siege, was
but a matter of time, and in the West, uncertainty still prevailed.
John R. Thompson’s spirited “A Word to the West,” was written when
Joseph E. Johnston was dispatched to relieve Vicksburg. It was at the
same time an answer to A. J. Requier’s impassioned plea, “Clouds in the
West.”

Those were anxious days, indeed. September saw the desperate conflict
at Sharpsburg, the bloodiest single day’s battle of the war, which,
although it was not a conclusive defeat, left the Confederate forces
wretchedly crippled, and brought deepest anguish to the South.
The gloom, however, was relieved in December by Lee’s victory at
Fredericksburg. So the second year of war closed on a people and a
nation, whose hearts were sick of the conflict. A second Christmas came
to the Confederacy to find only the grim realities of life instead of
the plumes and pomp of circumstance with which the war had begun. Mrs.
Preston drew the picture for her countrywomen, in _Beechenbrook_:

  How saddening the change is! The season’s the same,
  And yet it is Christmas in nothing but name:
  No merry expression we utter today--
  How can we, with hearts that refuse to be gay?
  We look back a twelfthmonth on many a brow
  That graced the home hearthstone--and where are they now?
  We think of the darling ones clustering there,
  But we see, through our tears, an untenanted chair.

None the less, the South was still firm in her resolve to battle to
the end. No sacrifice could be demanded so great that it would not be
willingly offered on the altar of Liberty--

  Thank God! there is joy in the sorrow for all--
  He fell--but it surely was blessed to fall;
  For never shall murmur be heard from the mouth
  Of mother or wife, through our beautiful South,
  Or sister or maiden yield grudging her part,
  Tho’ the price that she pays, must be coined from her heart.

1863 proved another “Year of terror, year of strife.” In the far South,
Butler, in possession of New Orleans, had begun his reign of terror
that was the savage inspiration of several poems. From Hayne, in
particular, it wrung one of the most powerful lyrics of the war.[14] Up
the river, the siege of Vicksburg still continued. How spring came to
the land was most poignantly expressed by Henry Timrod, in “Spring.”

  Spring, with that nameless pathos in the air
  Which dwells in all things fair,
  Spring, with her golden suns and silver rain
  Is with us once again.

         *       *       *       *       *

  Ah! who would couple thoughts of war and crime
  With such a blessed time.
  Who in the west-wind’s aromatic breath
  Could hear the call of Death!

         *       *       *       *       *

  Oh! standing on this desecrated mould,
  Methinks that I behold,
  Lifting her bloody daisies up to God,
  Spring kneeling on the sod,

         *       *       *       *       *

  And calling with the voice of her rills
  Upon the ancient Hills,
  To fall and crush the tyrants and the slaves
  Who turn her meads to graves.

Spring brought with it another bloody engagement and Confederate
victory, the Battle of Chancellorsville, fought in the first four days
of May. In that, however, it caused the death of Stonewall Jackson it
was, next to the actual surrender of the Southern army, the worst blow
the Confederacy could have sustained. His death, some one once said,
was like the death of an army. Certainly it took from Lee, already
overburdened, his good right hand.

The outburst of mourning that followed on Jackson’s death, has already
been noted. The South and her poets loved him, not only as a leader,
but personally, as a great and good man. He represented, moreover, that
element of faith and religious fervor which was one of the essential
factors of the Southern character, and without which the faith that
sustained the Confederacy through four years of war, and the days of
ruin that followed, is inexplicable.

“Let me say,” wrote Dr. Gildersleeve,[15] “that the bearing of the
Confederates is not to be understood without taking into account
the deep religious feeling of the army and its great leaders. It is
a historical element, like any other, and is not to be passed over
in summing up the forces of the conflict.” Many are the poems, the
“Prayers for the South,” and the individual supplications which still
remain to attest the fact. For example, there is the “Battle Hymn of
the Virginia Soldier,” an anonymous lyric of striking beauty. There is
the simpler, yet equally sincere and devout “Soldier’s Battle Prayer”
from the _Southern Literary Messenger_ for April, ’62. “A Mother’s
Prayer,” is another very touching poem, in the same theme: and there
could be no more impressive evidence of the true religious strain in
Southern hearts, than the verses, terrible in their satire, and burning
in their indignant phrases, “The War Christians’ Thanksgiving,” by
S. Teackle Wallis of Maryland, occasioned by the Union proclamation
for a day of prayer in the North, and “Respectfully Dedicated to the
War-Clergy of the United States, Bishops, Priests and Deacons.”
Written as it was by a prisoner then in the dungeon of Fort Warren, it
is one of the most powerful human documents of the War. At the same
time, the South held her own days of national prayer and fasting: and
the verses which her poets wrote on these occasions, were quite in
character with the national temper.

In the dark days of the next two years, the South was to find need
for all her faith and confidence in the right. As if Jackson’s death
was not sufficient evil, July first to third brought Lee’s defeat at
Gettysburg, and on the day after this battle, the fall of Vicksburg, on
the Mississippi. This meant the complete breaking of the Confederate
line in the Southwest, and the return of the Army of Northern Virginia
to its original position in Virginia. To complete the rout of the
Confederate line, the Union forces now began to beat through the
Southern defense in Tennessee and Kentucky, while Lee, back once more
in Virginia, maneuvered to and fro against Meade. In the Southern
campaign, the Confederates were steadily forced out of Tennessee, and
Chattanooga, the objective of the Union troops. This, (which was with
Richmond, the last important strategic point left to the Confederacy)
was wrested from Bragg, and occupied by Rosecrans on the ninth. The
latter thought that the fall of the city would be sufficient warning
to the Southerner, and that he and his forces would at once withdraw.
Far from doing that, however, Bragg engaged him, ten days later,
at Chickamauga. It was a two days’ battle, on the nineteenth and
twentieth, and was, next to Sharpsburg, the bloodiest engagement of
the War. Though a Confederate victory, it was dearly bought. Yet even
after all her suffering, the South willingly paid the price. Verses in
the Richmond _Sentinel_ called the river “Chickamauga, The Stream of
Death,” where the foe--

  Learned, though long unchecked they spoil us,
      Dealing desolation round,
  Marking, with the tracks of ruin
      Many a rood of Southern ground;
  Yet, whatever course they follow,
      Somewhere in their pathway flows
  Dark and deep, a Chickamauga,
      Stream of death to vandal foes.

  They have found it darkly flowing
      By Manassas’ famous plain,
  And by rushing Shenandoah
      Met the tide of woe again;
  Chickahominy, immortal,
      By the long ensanguined fight,
  Rappahannock, glorious river,
      Twice renowned for matchless fight.

  Heed the story, dastard spoilers,
      Mark the tale these waters tell,
  Ponder well your fearful lesson,
      And the doom that there befell;
  Learn to shun the Southern vengeance,
      Sworn upon the votive sword,
  Every stream a Chickamauga
      To the vile invading horde!

None the less, in the battles that followed, the Union forces
prevailed. In the three days’ fighting before Chattanooga, culminating
in the Battle of Missionary Ridge, on November twenty-fifth, the
Confederates were set in full flight. J. Augustine Signaigo described
this fight in “The Heights of Mission Ridge.” The final catastrophe had
begun.

It had been threatening for a long time. By the end of ’63, nearly
every Southern home had suffered some loss or sorrow. “Our Christmas
Hymn” by Dr. John Dickson Bruns of Charleston, put the grief of the
land into words.

  Wild bells! that shake the midnight air
      With those dear tones that custom loves,
  You wake no sounds of laughter here
      Nor mirth in all our silent groves;
  On one broad waste, by hill or flood,
      Of ravaged lands your music falls,
  And where the happy homestead stood
      The stars look down on roofless halls.

Timrod’s “Christmas, 1863,” shows a South that is sobered, and weary of
battle: who with no idea of yielding, nevertheless, yearns for peace.

      How grace this hallowed day?
  Shall happy bells, from yonder ancient spire,
  Send their glad greetings to each Christmas fire
      Round which the children play?

      How could we bear the mirth,
  While some loved reveller of a year ago
  Keeps his mute Christmas now beneath the snow,
      In cold Virginian earth?

         *       *       *       *       *

      How shall we grace the day?
  Oh! let the thought that on this holy morn
  The Prince of Peace--the Prince of Peace was born,
      Employ us, while we pray!

         *       *       *       *       *

      He who till time shall cease,
  Shall watch that earth, where once, not all in vain
  He died to give us peace, will not disdain
      A prayer whose theme is--peace.

      Perhaps, ’ere yet the spring
  Hath died into the summer, over all
  The land, the peace of His vast love shall fall
      Like some protecting wing.

         *       *       *       *       *

      Peace on the whirring marts,
  Peace where the scholar thinks, the hunter roams,
  Peace, God of Peace! peace, peace in all our homes,
      And peace in all our hearts!

1864 was a year to be endured in stricken anguish. After a comparative
lull during the first months of the war, on the fourth of May three
Union armies moved forward, two destined for Richmond to shatter what
part of the original Confederate line there was left, and one for
Atlanta against Johnston and Hood, setting out to employ the troops
still in the far South, and keep them from the relief of Lee and
Richmond. This latter campaign was to end in the fall of Atlanta, and
“Sherman’s March to the Sea,” and caused the invention of a new word.

  Gaunt and grim like a spectre rose that word before the world,
  From a land of bloom and beauty into ruin rudely hurled,
  From a people scourged by exile, from a city ostracised
  Pallas-like it sprang to being, and that word is--Shermanized.[16]

Atlanta fell, despite Hood’s frantic efforts, on September third, ’64.
Hood’s rashness in engaging in a counter attack against Nashville,
cost him several severe defeats, and finally his army. Tennessee was
thus brought entirely under Union control, and late in December, on
the twenty-fourth, Sherman occupied Savannah. Two poems, by the same
author, Alethea S. Burroughs of Georgia, commemorate this incident most
poignantly, “Savannah,” written in encouragement when her ruin seemed
impending, and “Savannah Fallen,” written after the occupation of the
town.

On the way to Savannah, Sherman’s route had lain through Columbia,
which had been pillaged and burned, a circumstance that was the
savage inspiration of James Barron Hope’s flaming verses, “A Poem
that Needs No Dedication.” The sack of Columbia caused the evacuation
of Charleston by the Confederate forces, then directly menaced, and
before the oncoming destroyer the city was deserted. The pitiful fate
of the city which had witnessed the birth and earliest days of the
Confederacy, could not fail to stir the anguish of the Southern poets.
“The Foe at the Gates,” by Dr. Bruns, for example, reveals the still
prevailing temper of the South.

  Ring round her! children of her glorious skies,
      Whom she hath nursed to stature proud and great;
  Catch one last glance from her imploring eyes,
      Then close your ranks and face the threatening fate.

  To save her proud soul from that loathed thrall
      Which yet her spirit cannot brook to name;
  Or, if her fate be near, and she must fall,
      Spare her--she sues--the agony and shame.

  From all her fanes let solemn bells be tolled,
      Heap with kind hands her costly funeral pyre,
  And thus, with paean sung and anthem rolled,
      Give her, unspotted, to the God of Fire.

  Gather around her sacred ashes, then,
      Sprinkle the cherished dust with crimson rain
  Die! as becomes a race of freeborn men,
      Who will not crouch to wear the bondsmen’s chain.

To the poets of the South, the fate of this city was particularly
significant, for if any place may be said to have been the literary
centre of the Confederacy, it was Charleston. There, for example,
lived Simms and Timrod and Hayne, the leaders of her lyrists, who,
in the general destruction of the city, suffered the loss of their
homes and libraries. Had Charleston been spared to them and to others,
the literary history of the South in the days after the war might
have been a different tale. As it was, the disaster to each of these
particular men proved irretrievable.

Lee, during the summer months, though stoutly resisting, and adroitly
circumventing the enemy at nearly every turn, was nevertheless being
forced back against Richmond. The Battles of the Wilderness, May fifth
and sixth, the Spottsylvania fighting, on the eighth to the twentieth,
and Cold Harbor, on June third, resulted in advantage first to one
side and to the other. Then the conflict swung below Richmond to
Petersburg, and for the next month, the Union forces were halted before
that strongly fortified town. The “Battle of the Crater” was fought
on July thirtieth, over ground destroyed by Federal mines, but it was
unsuccessful for the Unionists, and their losses were so terrific that
for the next winter, at least, Richmond was safe.

The Petersburg siege is noteworthy since during it were written some of
the most attractive lyrics of the war, like “Dreaming in the Trenches,”
by Gordon McCabe, and “A Bloody Day is Dawning,” by William Munford.
It is remarkable that such freshness of phrase could be given to men
wearied by three years of disappointing struggle. One may imagine that
this is but another indication of the vitality and spirit that was an
integral part of the Southern character.

By the end of ’64, the Confederate battle wall had been crumpled and
was beaten in, everywhere except in Virginia, before Richmond. Peace
for a stricken land was the immediate concern alike of poets and
people. Beyond that they did not trust themselves to think: but peace
was the universal prayer.

  Peace! Peace! God of our fathers, grant us Peace!
  Peace in our hearts, and at Thine altars; Peace
  On the red waters and their blighted shores;
  Peace for the leaguered cities, and the hosts
  That watch and bleed, around them and within;
  Peace for the homeless and the fatherless;
  Peace for the captive on his weary way,
  And the mad crowds who jeer his helplessness.
  For them that suffer, them that do the wrong--
  Sinning and sinned against--O, God! for all--
  For a distracted, torn and bleeding land--
  Speed the glad tidings! Give us, give us Peace.[17]

The end came quickly. After a winter of preparation, determined among
the Union forces, despairing among Lee’s men, the attack on Petersburg
was resumed and carried on April second, of ’65. The next day, Richmond
fell. Lee found escape impossible, and on the twelfth the little white
farmhouse at Appomattox Court House, in the meeting of Lee and Grant,
witnessed at once the death of a young nation and the rebirth of an
older one.

Lyric as had always been the poetic genius of the South, it was but
natural that her anguished cry of despair and defeat should be put into
the mouths of her poets. For the most part, the poems on this theme are
of beautiful quality, and those still extant form the largest single
class in the war poetry of the four years.[18] Correspondingly, they
constitute a glass wherein one may see how defeat came to the South,
and how she met the challenge of the issue. There were, of course, some
spirits which cried out beneath the unendurable prick that death itself
had been preferable to defeat. There is not emotion more appalling
than despair for which one sees no relieving element of comfort. Such
poems as “Stack Arms,” by Joseph Blythe Alston, “Doffing the Gray,”
by Lieutenant Falligant, “The Price of Peace” by “Luola” or “Peace”
by Alethea Burroughs of Savannah are terrible expressions of this
attitude. At the same time, there were those who like Mrs. Preston, in
“Acceptation,” met the issue more bravely and gently:

  We do accept thee, heavenly Peace!
      Albeit thou comest in a guise
      Unlooked for--undesired, our eyes
  Welcome, thro’ tears, the kind release
  From war and woe and want--surcease
  For which we bless thee, holy Peace!

  We lift our foreheads from the dust;
      And as we meet thy brow’s clear calm,
      There falls a freshening sense of balm
  Upon our spirits. Fear--distrust--
  The hopeless present on us thrust--
  We’ll front them as we can, and must.

         *       *       *       *       *

  Then courage, brothers! Tho’ our breast
      Ache with that rankling thorn, despair,
      That failure plants so sharply there--
  No pang, no pain shall be confessed;
  We’ll work and watch the brightening west,
  And leave to God and Heaven, the rest.

There were others who accepted the inevitable gracefully, but defiantly.

  Weep, if thou wilt, with proud sad mien,
      Thy blasted hopes--thy peace undone;
      Yet brave, live on--nor seek to shun
  Thy fate, like Egypt’s conquered queen.

  Though forced a captive’s place to fill,
      In the triumphal train--yet there,
      Superbly, like Zenobia, wear
  Thy chains--_Virginia victrix_ still.[19]

There were yet others to whom the fall of the Confederacy was typified
in the furling of its banner. Poems like “The Conquered Banner,”
by Father Ryan, and J. C. M.’s “Cruci Dum Spiro, Fido,” and A. J.
Requier’s “Ashes of Glory” are typical expressions of such spirits.
Then there were those who, like D. B. Lucas, “In the Land Where We Were
Dreaming,” began to regard the struggle as the passing of a spirit
world with which had passed all chivalry and beauty.

There are many of these verses portraying the end, each slightly
differing in spirit from the one before, each repaying careful study
with the beauty of its melody, and as a class, forming the noblest
group of the war poems, whose only companions may be the earliest of
the “Cry to Arms” series. Yet these poems of defeat are infinitely the
more appealing in that the fire and dash of the earlier verses has here
given way to the dignity of sorrow. “For the people’s hopes are dead.”

Hundreds of poems written during the four years of conflict reflect
either individual reactions to war conditions, or incidents of battle.
Besides these there are the prison verses, humorous pieces, and
the southern songs, which in no way concern the historical passage
of the War. There are poems of personal feeling, for example, like
the exquisite and tender “The Confederate Soldier’s Wife Parting
From Her Husband” or Major S. Y. Levy’s “Love Letter,” or Fanny
Downing’s “Dreaming.” There are poems that picture the life of the
civilian population, like “The Homespun Dress” by Miss Sinclair, or
the anonymous “Your Mission” which is of more than passing interest
since in the South it was attributed equally to John R. Thompson,
Mrs. Preston, Paul H. Hayne, and Mrs. Browning.[20] There are poems
reflecting the ravages of the war on the families of the soldiers,
like “Heart Victories,” “Somebody’s Darling,” “Reading the List,”
“Volunteered,” and “The Unreturning.” One could continue the catalogue
indefinitely.

The prison verse, while not extensive, is for the most part, of
good quality. There are five men whose work may be considered as
representative, S. Teackle Wallis, who was imprisoned at Fort Warren,
and four at Johnson’s Island. Wallis’s “To The Exchanged Prisoners”
was written in Fort Warren in July ’62, and is one of the first of the
prison poems which we can identify as such. The others, Major A. S.
Hawkins, Colonel Beuhring H. Jones, Colonel W. W. Fontaine, and Major
George McKnight, (“Asa Hartz,”) wrote two years later, in ’64 and
’65. Hawkins was the author of many poems, all of them popular, “The
Hero Without a Name,” “To Infidelia,” “True to the Last,” “Give Up,”
“A Prisoner’s Fancy.” About the best known of Beuhring Jones’ verses
were “To a Dear Comforter,” and the rather humorous “Rat den Linden.”
Fontaine was the author of many poems, notably “The Countersign,”
“Virginia Desolate,” and “The Cliff Beside the Sea.” It remained
for “Asa Hartz” to while away his prison hours in writing lines so
delightfully humorous, so free and swift moving, that it is difficult
to believe they could have been written within prison walls. “Living or
Dying,” “Will No One Write to Me?” “To Exchange-Commissioner Ould,” and
“My Love and I” are among the best of his lighter verses: “Exchanged,”
and “Farewell to Johnson’s Island” are of more sober temper. “My Love
and I” is the best example of his work:

  My love reposes on a rosewood frame--
            A bunk have I;
  A couch of feathery down fills up the same--
            Mine’s straw, but dry;
  She sinks to sleep at night with scarce a sigh--
  With waking eyes I watch the hours creep by.

  My love her daily dinner takes in state--
            And so do I (?);
  The richest viands flank her silver plate--
            Course grub have I.
  Pure wines she sips at ease, her thirst to slake--
  I pump my drink from Erie’s limpid lake!

  My love has all the world at will to roam--
            Three acres I;
  She goes abroad, or quiet sits at home--
            So cannot I;
  Bright angels watch around her couch at night--
  A Yank, with loaded gun, keeps me in sight.

  A thousand weary miles do stretch between
            My love and I;
  To her, this wintry night, cool, calm, serene,
            I waft a sigh;
  And hope with all my earnestness of soul,
  Tomorrow’s mail may bring me my parole!

  There’s hope ahead! We’ll one day meet again--
            My love and I;
  We’ll wipe away all tears of sorrow then,
            Her lovelit eye
  Will all my many troubles then beguile,
  And keep this wayward reb. from Johnston’s Isle.

The poetry dealing with incidents of the war is varied, and touches
many subjects. There were such verses for example, as “The Silent
March,” by Walker Meriweather Bell, written on an occasion during the
war when General Lee was lying asleep by the wayside and an army of
fifteen thousand men “passed by with hushed voices and footsteps, lest
they should disturb his slumbers;” “Stonewall Jackson’s Way,” written
on the theme of the great general’s ability “always to be where needed
and in the thick of things;” “The Lone Sentry,” based on an incident,
common to all wars, of the great general relieving a weary sentry;
“The Battle Rainbow” by John R. Thompson, inspired by the rainbow
that appeared the evening before the beginning of the Seven Days of
Battle before Richmond. “The rainbow overspread the eastern sky, and
exactly defined the position of the Confederate army, as seen from the
Capitol at Richmond.” There were poems like “Music in Camp” also by
John R. Thompson, suggested by an incident that occurred just after
Chancellorsville: and “The Unknown Hero,” by W. Gordon McCabe, based on
the discovery, “after the Battle of Malvern Hill, of a [Confederate]
soldier lying dead fifty yards in advance of any man or officer, his
musket firmly grasped in the rigid fingers, name unknown, simply ‘2 La’
on his cap.”

Another interesting group of poems, closely connected with the war,
although not with the actual progress of events, is found in the
national and the army songs which were sung in camp and field and by
the fire-side. It was natural that “Dixie” should be the most popular
of airs, and while it admitted of endless variations and sentiments,
the words that were generally sung to it were those by Albert Pike.
The Marseillaise was another widely popular air, to which were sung
any number of poems. One of these “The Southern Marseillaise” by A.
E. Blackmar, written early in 1861, was sung by the troops as they
marched to their assembling points, and may very properly be called the
Rallying Song of the South.

“The Bonnie Blue Flag,” by Harry Macarthy was the favorite of the
popular national songs. It was first sung by him on the stage of the
Academy of Music in New Orleans, in September, 1861, and caused such
excitement that the event precipitated a riot. When General Butler
was in command of the city, two years later, he threatened to impose
a fine of twenty-five dollars on any man, woman or child who sang it.
In addition he arrested the publisher, A. E. Blackmar, destroyed the
sheet music, and fined him five hundred dollars. After the tune became
established as a favorite, Mrs. Annie Chambers Ketchum of Kentucky
wrote other words to the air, which were frequently used.[21] In
addition to the national songs, the various states used particular
anthems. Maryland had Randall’s song, “Maryland, My Maryland.” For
South Carolina there were Timrod’s noble lines in the same strain,
“Carolina.” “Georgia, My Georgia” was written by Carrie Bell Sinclair,
and the “Song of the Texas Rangers” by Mrs. J. D. Young. These are but
a few among a longer list.

It has been said[22] that while the Confederate Army was not
“absolutely destitute of songs, it simply lacked a plentiful supply
of songs written especially for the moment.” This is far from being
the case. Indeed, the camp songs and marching ballads written in the
Confederate camps during the war, are legion. They vary in excellence
from “The Cavaliers’ Glee” by Captain William Blackford of Stuart’s
staff, to the extremely popular and delightful “Goober Peas,” by A.
Pender. For the camp catches there were certain stock tunes, such as
the “Happy Land of Canaan,” “Wait for the Wagon,” “We’ll Be Free in
Maryland,” “Gay and Happy,” which were used over and over, and to which
words were improvised to fit the occasion. Even the slender Confederate
Navy had her stock of ballads. “The Alabama,” by E. King, author of
“Naval Songs of the South,” is the best representative of this class.

It is not strange that during the chaotic days of the Confederacy,
poems that had been written by Southerners in antebellum days were
published in the South as of Confederate origin; and that poems of
the war period written in the North or abroad should be attributed
to Confederate authors. In the first category are verses such as
“My Wife and Child,” by Henry R. Jackson of Georgia, which he wrote
during the Mexican War, and in the second class, “The Soldier Boy,” a
widely popular poem which was really by the Englishman, Dr. William
Maginn (1793-1842), whom Thackeray satirized as “Captain Shalow” in
_Pendennis_, but which was assigned to “H. M. L.” of Lynchburg, and
even given the circumstantial date of May 18, 1861. Another poem that
was widely copied, but which was really written by T. Buchanan Read in
Rome in 1861, was “The Brave at Home.”

Two other poems whose origins have attracted much attention are “The
Confederate Note,” by Major S. A. Jonas of Mississippi, and “All Quiet
Along the Potomac Tonight,” by Mrs. Ethel Lynn Beers. Major Jonas seems
to have established unquestionable claim to his poem in a letter to
the Louisville _Courier_, under date of December 11, 1889. The poem
by Mrs. Beers was a long time claimed for Lomar Fontaine. Mrs. Beers
had written the verses in 1861, in which year they had appeared in
_Harper’s Weekly_. Late in ’62 they began to circulate in the South,
and for some unknown reason were assigned to Lomar Fontaine. He was at
once showered with praise and eulogy, but it is interesting to note
that in the Editor’s Table of the _Southern Literary Messenger_ for
June, 1863 (p. 375) at the end of verses by Henry C. Alexander “To
Lomar Fontaine, the author of the verses entitled ‘All Quiet Along the
Potomac Tonight,’ and if report be true, one of the unrewarded heroes
of the South” the Editor has subscribed the following discriminating
comment: “It is questionable whether Fontaine wrote the ‘All Quiet
Along the Potomac.’ There was no occasion to incite such a poem. Our
pickets along the Potomac were rarely if ever shot: those of the
Yankees were shot night after night.[23] We have heard that the author
of the lines attributed to Fontaine is an Ohioan. A brave man--a hero,
if you will,--Fontaine has yet to prove that he is a poet.”

One other poem whose origin has been questioned is “The Countersign,”
which, reprinted in the Philadelphia _Press_ in 1861, was declared
to have been written by a private in Company G, Stuart’s Engineer
Regiment, at Camp Lesley, near Washington. F. F. Browne, in _Bugle
Echoes_, cryptically adds: “But it may now be stated positively that it
was written by a Confederate soldier, still living. The third line of
the fifth stanza affords internal evidence of Southern origin.” This
Confederate soldier was Colonel W. W. Fontaine.

Metrical study of the Southern war poetry leads inevitably to the
conclusion that Southern temperament lent itself naturally to rhythmic
expression. The poets of the South, many of them untrained in the
technique of their art, wrote in every metrical arrangement that can be
imagined, from curious irregular unrhymed rhythms to ballad measure,
and to the long and intricate stanzaic forms used by Simms and Timrod.
In nearly every case, except, of course, with the cruder camp songs,
the verses flow felicitously, and the effect is melodious. Even in the
sonnet form[24] although the Southerner did not seem capable of writing
a true sonnet, the rhythm moves with ease and harmony. The verses may
infringe every rule of the sonnet form, but the result is effective.

Such is the achievement of the Southern war verse. It is a wonderfully
effective expression of sentiment, and becomes all the more remarkable
when one considers the conditions under which it was created. It was
written in a land first rich and prosperous, then through four weary
years ravaged and starved into ruin: by soldiers in the field and in
the prisons, and women suffering silently at home. Even the mediums
through which this poetry was published, shared the vicissitudes of the
land, and have been generally destroyed or scattered. Nevertheless the
war poetry of the Confederacy which remains to us today, stands as an
enduring memorial to the inherent nobility of the Southern heart and to
the fidelity of devotion to principle, which has always given the South
the admiration of those who, while they cannot agree with her point of
view, must nevertheless respect her courage and spirit. At the same
time it forms a notable contribution to the literature of our land.
Best of all, this poetry satisfies the function of those “Sentinel
Songs” of which Father A. J. Ryan wrote, on May sixth, 1867:

  When sinks the soldier brave
      Dead at the feet of Wrong,
  The poet sings, and guards his grave
      With sentinels of song.

         *       *       *       *       *

  When marble wears away
      And monuments are dust,
  The Songs that guard our soldiers’ clay
      Will still fulfill their trust.

    _Abram_: A Military Poem. By A. Young Rebelle, Esq., of the
    Army. Richmond: Macfarlane & Fergusson, 1863.

    [“A string of smoothly running rhymes about Lincoln, Stonewall,
    McClellan, Pope, Burnside & Co., with a very droll preface
    in place of an appendix. The author is a Texan, and we doubt
    not his comrades of Hood’s old brigade will enjoy this little
    book nearly as much as they do a hard day’s fight after a long
    march.”--Review in _The Southern Literary Messenger_, for
    March, 1863.]

    [“This is one of the almost numberless catalogues of
    ‘Songbooks,’ ‘Songsters,’ etc., which has been published during
    the War,--rejoicing in such patriotic titles as the ‘Rebel,’
    ‘Stonewall,’ ‘Soldiers,’ etc., which with a most refreshing
    contempt for consistency in name and date, embrace sprinklings
    from the lyric music of almost every age and clime. ‘No One to
    Love,’ ‘Rory O’More,’ ‘Kathleen Mavourneen,’ ‘Marseillaise,’
    etc., etc., of course, figure extensively. We suppose the ‘Army
